Eliminate Negative Number
Given an array "x", say [1,5,10,-2]
Create an algorithm that replaces any negative numbers with the value of 0
When the program is done, "x" should have no negative values, say [1,5,10,0]

//PSUEDO CODE

create a function that takes in a parameter (x)
iterate through each number in that array until the length of that array
check value of each num to check if negative or positive
if negative, we want to replace with value 0 in that position
if positive leave as is


var x = [1,5, 10, -2];

function eliminateNegativeNum(x) {
  for(i=0; i < x.length; i++) {

    if(x[i] < 0) {
    x[i] = 0;
    }
  }
  console.log(x);
}
eliminateNegativeNum(x);
