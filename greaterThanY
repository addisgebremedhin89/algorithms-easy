Psuedo code:
1)declare a function that takes in two arguments through a list of instructions
2)one of the parameters (arg) will be an array and the othe will be unknownY
3) we will want to look at each object of the array through a loop that begins at the zero index and goes through the length of that given array iterating every single value
4) we now want to compare the arguments by asking "is this value (i) greather than y"?
5) if it is we want to count that object
6) if not we dont need


function greaterThanY(inputArray, y)

var count = 0;
for(i=0; i<=arr.length; i++){
if(inputArray[i] > y){
count++;
 }
}
console.log("There were greather than" ,count+" values greater than, ", threshold+ in the array");

var test = [21, 54, 12, 7];
var threshold = 6;

greaterThanY (test, threshold);

}

console.log(x.length);
