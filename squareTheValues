Square the Values

Given any array "x", say [1, 5, 10, 2],
Create an algorithm (set of instructions)
that multiples each value in the array by itself
when the program is done, the array "x" should have
values that have been squared, say [1. 25. 100. 4]

Psuedo Code

1. Given a parameter "x" that will pass through a set of instructions
2. Each value of the array will be ran thru a loop that begins at the 0 index and goes through the length of that array which will increment through each index value
3. The first index in array "x" will be assigned to the first index in "x" multiplied by itself
4. Repeat step 4 until th ened of the array length
5. Print (console.log) parameter x
6. Invoke the function

var x = [1,5, 10, -2];

function squareTheValues(x) {
for(i=0; i < x.length; i++) {

x[i] = x[i] * x[i];

}
console.log(x);

}
squareTheValues(x);

///////

reassigning a variable in the global scope, re assign that variable while invoking the function

creating a t table before writing code

Array [2,3,5,9]
i             0  1  2  3
array[i]      2  3  5  9
output [i]    4  9  25 81

why are arrays changebale in local and global

when you override an index because you referencing the memory location of each index value of this array.
